# Node.js Fundamentals Project

This project dives deep into the core concepts of Node.js and server-side programming, inspired by the [LearnYouNode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) workshop. From creating basic web servers to handling file systems and making HTTP requests, this project is designed to equip you with the necessary skills to build robust server applications.

## How to Use

This project is organized into exercises that cover different aspects of Node.js:

- **Level 1:** Using LearnYouNode to verify solutions.
- **Level 2:** Creating custom scripts for each exercise.
- **Level 3:** Implementing exercises in TypeScript and adding tests.

To run a specific exercise, use the following command, substituting `exercise_name.ts` with the name of the file:
